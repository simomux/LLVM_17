# Second assignment of my middle-end compilers class: Dataflow analysis

This assignment explores dataflow analysis for:

* Very busy expressions
* Dominator analysis
* Constant propagation

For each problem, we'll define:

* **Domain**
* **Direction (Forward/Backward)**
* **Transfer Function**
* **Meet Operator**
* **Boundary Condition**

We'll have to define another table for each problem that shows `in` and `out` set values for each program point at each solving step.
